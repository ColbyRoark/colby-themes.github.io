          <span class="v2_4">Jailbreaking is a term that refers to installing third-party software onto an Apple device, in most cases their flagship iPhones.
            I have always been interested in this community, with my first jailbroken iPod touch in middle school.
            That interest eventually led me to my career choice of graphic design, as well as my project in which I am the most proud of.
            Iâ€™ve designed a handful of different iOS (and eventually Android) icon packs, diving head-first into the realm of UI and UX design.
